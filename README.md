# [Carbon LDP Javascript SDK](http://carbonldp.com/)

## Introduction

Carbon provides the building blocks, tools, and services that developers need to build with freedom and creativity. It exposes a JSON/REST API through which apps can manage information - listing, creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources of any type. The resources used by a Carbon app can conform to any schema, which does not have to be pre-created and which can change without the need for schema changes in the datastore. The platform provides application development features in a GUI that allow developers to work visually and easily before any of the visual elements of their own app are produced. For those parts of an app that are non-visual, or for developing web services, the platform provides a JavaScript API and a variety of server-side modules. The JavaScript API is designed to abstract and simplify use of the JSON/REST API - allowing developers to focus primarily on the GUI and logic that is unique to their application. Server-side modules execute logic on the server and perform functions that are commonly required (e.g. uploading, e-mailing, caching). In addition to providing a host of useful modules as building blocks, developers can extend their apps and the platform itself by registering custom modules. Custom modules leverage a server-side scripting language that eliminates the need for developers to wrestle with deploying compiled packages.

JavaScript is the universal language of the web. Modern web applications leverage JavaScript to create a rich experience. When combined with the data storage and retrieval power of linked data, complex and useful applications can be built. The SDK for JavaScript builds and abstracts upon the REST API to create objects and functions that make it easier and more convenient to interact with platform features.

## Quick start

Carbon's Javascript SDK uses the [JSON-LD](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld.js) so to get started you need to include the **jsonld.js** and **carbon-1.0.0.js**.
